# JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins

What is programming:

1. Programming is the way humans tell computers to do logical things for them in a systematic fashion. It lets humans create ways for other people to interact using computers
2. There are a wide variety of programming languages, BUT to decide which to use, we need to decide what we want to use it FOR, and then pick the language best suited for the use

JavaScript is powerful because it is:

1. multi-paradigm (can accommodate a range of thinking/programming styles)
2. prototype-based (things defined can be changed easily)
3. designed to be used for the Web 
4. also is a full-stack language (can be used both on the client / server)
